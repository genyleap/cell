***WARNING:*** Errors may occur frequently during the build process.

## What is this engine?
Cell Engine (CE) is an advanced computer software engine developed by Genyleap (Kambiz Asadzadeh) and its test versions in the alpha draft mode were first shown in product development in 2023. It is an exclusive cross-platform software engine written in C++20, designed to enable developers to build multi-purpose high-end products with exceptional speed and efficiency. With support for multiple languages, a modern architecture, and cross-platform functionality, Cell engine is the perfect tool for developing versatile software products that can run seamlessly across different platforms.


## Introduction:
The construction and development of software products often involve various methodologies, architectures, and techniques, necessitating constant updates and repetitions based on requirements. However, the technical knowledge and infrastructure needed for software projects across different domains, platforms, and specific conditions can be time-consuming and costly. Requirements management plays a critical role in efficient development, as access to resources and techniques is often dependent on the developers' experience and expertise. In this white paper, we propose a method for solving development problems and integrated infrastructure management in different software domains using Cell Engine as the core component.
